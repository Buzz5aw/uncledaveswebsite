						<h2 class="question">
							Do I need an asphalt shingle roof?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							You can put a solar electric system on almost any roof type including wood, metal, cement tile, and definitely asphalt. Installation cost will vary based on the type of roof. 
						</p>


						<h2 class="question">
							How much roof area is needed?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							A solar electric system requires about 100 square feet for each kilowatt (kW). Unless your power usage is very high, most likely you will have enough roof space to accommodate a system. <br><br> <a class="answer_link" href="freedesign.html"> Click here for your free design!</a><br>
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Are the chimneys, vents, or skylights on my roof a concern?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							The solar panel array can be designed so that it cleanly outlines any roof penetrations. Depending on a chimney's location, it may create an unacceptable shadow. Your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative can determine during the site survey whethersuch shadowing will cause an impact. Generally, low profile attic exhaust vents and skylights are not a concern. Relocation of plumbing vents can often be done cost effectively to gain usable roof space and a more consistent array design.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Do I need to move my satellite dish?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Possibly, the site survey will indicate whether the dish presents a shading concern or is a mounting obstruction.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Are the dormers and gables on my roof a concern?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Not necessarily, if there is sufficient space on the roof that is not shaded, your system will be fine.Another alternative may be high efficiency panels to maximize the output of a smaller roof area. Such panels will generally be more costly. Your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative can make apropriate recommendations when performing an on-site analysis. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							How much sunlight do I need?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							 The greater the amount of sunlight reaching your panels the more electricity you will produce and the more profitable your system will be. If your panels can not be optimally placed because of roof orientation to obtain the required electricity production to meet your needs, you may require a larger system. A larger system may consist of more panels or the same number of more efficient panels. Using satellite imagery software, New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions can often make a determination given your roof orientation as to the whether a system will receive enough sunlight to make an investment a prudent decision. <br><br> <a class="answer_link" href="freedesign.html"> Click here for your free design!</a><br>
						</p>


						<h2 class="question">
							What is the payback period for solar if I purchase my system?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							The payback for your solar electric system depends on various factors including the installed cost of your system, the price of electricity, and the federal and state incentives that are of advantage to you, solar renewable energy credit prices, how much electricity you use and how much sun your panels receive. In New Jersey your payback could be as short as two years with an outright cash investment. After a brief analysis, a New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative will be able to approximate your payback period. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							I have a combined bill, will I be able to offset my natural gas charges? 
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							No, your solar electric system generation that is fed into the utility's grid will only be offset against the electric part of your bill regardless of whether it is a combined bill. In New Jersey, if your bill for the electric portion is in excess of $100 per month, your usage is probably high enough to warrant an investment in a solar electric system.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							I just moved into a brand new house, how do I know what the bills will be?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Often you can wait a few months to see what your bills will be and approximate your annual usage. Neighbors with a similar home can also be a good source of estimation if you only have one or two bills to rely upon.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							 I just moved, how do I know what the bills will be?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Realtors often keep copies of the previous ownerâ€™s utility bills. That information along with a few months of your own usage can provide a good estimate of your annual usage. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							If I generate more electricity than I use, will the electric company buy it?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Yes but within limits. New Jersey is a net meter state which allows you to offset the electricity you take from the utility grid with the amounts you generate. All the electricity you offset is done so at retail electric rates since if it were not offset that is the rate you would pay the utility for the power. Although a carryover is allowed from month to month, annually the net excess is paid out at the utilities avoided cost which is much less than the current retail rate.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Can I increase the system size later with additional panels?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Sure, but often a separate array must be created since the original system components would have been sized for a specific capacity. This is done to optimize the system's efficiency and performance which is very important for you to maximize system profitability. Additions are more common with commercial installations where significant additional capacity is added. For residential systems, often adding the panels from the start is the most cost effective option if there is any consideration of adding panels in the future.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							How long will my solar electric system last?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							The life of most solar electric systems are estimated at between 25 and 35 years. Panel manufacturers generally guarantee that your panels will have at least 80% of the power generating ability they had when they were first installed. The system's inverter which takes the DC electricity and converts it to AC electricity will most likely need to be replaced during the system's life. It is expected that future inverters will have higher efficiencies and the routine replacement will boost your system's AC power output. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Do I need to perform regular maintenance on my system?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Solar electric systems need to follow a regular maintenance schedule to keep their peak efficiency, although the schedule is nowhere as rigorous as required for most air conditioning and heating units. The owner can often perform some simple maintenance such as cleaning the panels but other routine service should be contracted to qualified personnel. Your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative can give you an overview of the services you might need with the system you have chosen. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Can my homeowners association (HOA) in New Jersey prohibit my system? 
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							 In 2007, New Jersey enacted legislation preventing homeowners associations from prohibiting the installation of solar collectors on certain types of residential properties. This law covers only dwellings that are not deemed community property of the association, including townhouses which have at least two sides that are unattached to any other building and for which the owner, rather than the association, is responsible for roof maintenance. In addition, the law applies specifically to systems installed onthe roofs of qualifying dwellings. Presumably this means that it does notextend the same protections to ground mounted systems. A homeowners association is permitted to regulate certain aspects of a solar collectors, including the qualifications of installation personnel, collector location, concealment and size. However, any regulation that would increase the collectors' installation and maintenance cost by greater than 10%, or would prevent the system from operating at maximum efficiency, may not be enforced. Your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative will need to work with you to determine the specifics of your situation. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							What if my trees shade the roof where the panel are to be installed?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Shading that occurs in the early morning or late afternoon may not be a significant concern but to generate maximum output, your panels should be shade free at other times during the day. If you want a system, you will need to either remove the shading trees or have them topped (cut down to an acceptable height). For two story homes this is often aesthetically pleasing. In the absence of pruning, heavy tree cover normally creates other concerns such as moisture accumulation and home damage from rubbing branches. Sometimes, simply removing one large branch is enough.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							What happens if my neighbor's trees block my panels?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							New Jersey law provides for the creation of solar easements to ensure that proper sunlight is available to those who operate solar-energy systems. You might have to work out the detail of such an easement with your neighbor and then have it recorded as with any other type of easement. Determining who carries the cost of initial topping and maintenance will need to be resolved but if you have a good relationship with your neighbor, issues should be few. You may need to work with your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative to make sure everything goes smoothly. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							What happens if my ranch is shaded by the three story home next door?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							You may be out of luck unless you have a sunny roof area such as a carport or large shed. Another alternative, if you have available land, is to mount your panels on the ground.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							My neighbors complain about everything, do I need their approval? 
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Most likely you can ignore them and since we'll be requesting your permits we'll either know beforehand or can find out if you'll have any concerns. Many newer panels. Especially those with a black face and frame are considered aesthetically pleasing. Your neighbor will undoubtedly love them and want to get some for his roof! 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							What if my municipality likes to delay and never approves anything? 
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Solar electric systems have become popular and municipalities are becoming more familiar with the regulatory issues associated with them. New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions generally handles the permitting process with all governmental agencies and will be the direct contact for the municipality which relieves you of any permitting and inspection burdens.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Do I need a zoning permit for my system? 
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Most municipalities are now requiring homeowners obtain a zoning permit as a requirement to obtain in a building and electrical permit for the installation. Costs for such a permit vary but can be as high as $100 or more. Some municipalities have created ordinances that detail not only the placement of modules and their attachment but also their color and other aesthetic attributes. Some have made setbacks for ground mounts significant so general housing development homeowners can not install ground mounts even if they have significant areas of sunny yard. New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions can assist in the process of obtaining a permit and design the system so that it meets ordinance. Generally, zoning for a rooftop installation tends to be less involved than a ground mount (setback, fencing, and buffer vegetation, etc.).
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							If the utility power goes out, will I still have power from the system
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							No. The system will shut down to avoid what is called islanding which is a safety concern. If your system were to remain operational and be feeding electricity into the grid, utility workers could be endangered. If you install an optional backup battery system, you can continue to maintain power. Another alternative is to acquire a permanent backup natural gas or propane generator with an automatic transferswitch. Ask your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative about these options.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Will solar increase my New Jersey property taxes?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							No. the State of New Jersey has a property tax exemption in place for solar electric systems.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Are the panels as lightweight as they look?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Yes, even with the required mounting components, they only add a few pounds per square foot which is well below the additional capacity most residential and commercial structures can hold. Most jurisdictions now require professional engineer stamped drawings for each installation that deal with weight and wind loads.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Do you have to drill holes in my roof to mount the panels?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Yes, the racks the panels mount to must be secured to the structural members of your roof. For flat roof commercial buildings, non-penetrating mounts are available.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Is a hot summer day the best weather for my solar system?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							In New Jersey, the sun is bright in the summer but we also have high humidity levels (you can see it as haze when crossing high bridges or when in tall buildings). The moisture in the air absorbs and scatters the sunlight causing panels to be less efficient than if the air is clear. Accordingly, cool days with low humidity and bright sun in the fall and spring or other times of the year are the best weather for systems.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Does my system still generate power when it is cloudy, rainy, or foggy?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Yes, since photovoltaic panels utilize both direct and indirect solar radiation, scattered or diminished sunlight will still allow you to create power, although at reduced levels commensurate with the deterioration in the weather. For New Jersey, fog tends to be early in the morning when power generation is normally low
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Does my system still generate power when covered by snow?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							No, when covered they will not generate electricity but since they are located in the sunniest areas of your roof, normally the snow will melt quickly and because the front face of the panels is very flat, the snow will slide right off. New Jersey normally does not have prolonged periods of snow and very cold weather so your panels should not remain covered for any significant period of time. We do not ecommend manually cleaning snow off the panels because of the danger of slipping on an icy roof and the potential for damage to the panels from rigid ice and the tools you might use.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Is hail and lightning a concern? 
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Generally not as most solar panels are guaranteed to withstand hail and designed to withstand lightning. You should discuss your specific concerns with your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative during the site survey.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Are animals attracted to the panels and wiring?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Solar panels are hermetically sealed and unless broken their interiors do not present a habitat for insects or animals. Exterior grade wiring is used in exposed locations, however, squirrels have been known to chew on module wiring. If you currently have squirrel issues, you should discuss this with your New Jersey Clean Energy Solutions representative to determine whether your system will require special guarding to keep out squirrels.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Why does the Federal Stimulus legislation affect my solar decision?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							As a homeowner, your tax credit of 30% is now unlimited.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Can I install a system if I lease my office or industrial space?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Most likely you will have to speak with and obtain approval from your landlord. Reviewing your lease can be a preliminary step prior to taking any formal action. 
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							Does it make sense to install a system if my lease is short-term?
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							Probably not since the cost to remove and reinstall the system would not be cost effective. An alternative would be to negotiate with the landlord as to whether the system could be purchased at fair market value. Yet another alternative would be panels that are ballasted on a flat roof rather than hard mounted. Such a system would be less expensive to relocate. In any event, it would be wise to speak with your landlord prior to taking any formal action.
						</p>



						<h2 class="question">
							We are not profitable so how can we benefit from the tax credit? 
						</h2>
					
						<p class="answer">
							This is a definite concern for C corporations. If the system size is significant enough to make third party ownership viable, non-profitable businesses may still be able to host a system and therefore benefit from low power prices and green marketing. In the case of S corporations, Partnerships, LLC, and LLP entities, the credit is generally a pass through to the shareholders or partners and could be used to offset taxation of income at the owner level.
